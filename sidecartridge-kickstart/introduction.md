## Project Background

The development of the SidecarTridge Kickstart emulator comes from the TOS Emulator for Atari ST computers, and originated from a need identified during the creation of the SidecarTridge multi-device cartridge for Atari ST. One of the significant challenges encountered was testing firmware across different ROM versions. Existing software solutions often proved unreliable, leading to a cumbersome and inefficient testing process.

Frustrated by the limitations of software-based testing, I decided to develop a hardware solution that could emulate the ROMs at the signal level. This led to the creation of the [SidecarTridge ROM emulator board](/sidecartridge-rom/), a device designed to replicate the functionality of the venerable 27CXXXX ROMs (and their equivalents) used in the Atari ST.

By leveraging the bit-banged emulation capabilities, it provides a reliable and effective means of testing and running different ROM versions. This innovation not only addressed the initial testing challenges but also opened up new possibilities for managing and utilizing various TOS (for Atari ST) and Kickstart (for Amiga) versions and custom ROMs with ease.

Hence, the SidecarTridge Kickstart emulator combines the core functionality of the ROM emulator board with carrier boards designed to fit seamlessly into the Amiga series. This integration combines modern technology with the classic Amiga hardware, providing users with a versatile and efficient tool for enhancing their retro computing experience.

## Key Hardware Components

The SidecarTridge Kickstart emulator comprises several key components, each playing a vital role in its functionality and ease of use. Below is a list and description of the main components:

1. **[SidecarTridge ROM Emulator Board](/sidecartridge-rom/)**: This is the core of the SidecarTridge Kickstart emulator. It leverages the Programmable Input Output (PIO) features of the Raspberry RP2040 and RP235x to emulate a ROM chip at the signal level. This board houses the necessary circuitry and flash memory to store multiple custom ROMs, provides the interface for USB connectivity, and communicates with the Amiga bus through TTL (5 volts)to CMOS (3.3 Volts) bus level shifters.

2. **SidecarTridge Amiga Model Carrier Board**: The carrier boards are designed to fit seamlessly into A500 and A200 Amiga computers. It connects the ROM emulator board to the Amiga bus, allowing the emulator to communicate with the motherboard and provide the necessary signals transparently. The current versions of the carrier boards are designed to fit the Amiga A500 and A2000.

3. **USB Cable (Optional)**: A standard USB-C cable is needed to connect the SidecarTridge ROM emulator board to a computer. This connection is used for transferring ROM image files and custom ROMs to the emulator, making it appear as a mass storage device for easy file management. The USB cable also provides power to the emulator during the firmware update process and file transfer. 

4. **RESCUE connector (Optional)**: The RESCUE connector is a crucial accessory for troubleshooting and recovery. In case of any issues with a new ROM image, the RESCUE cable can be used to restore the system to a known good ROM version, ensuring the computer can boot correctly and reliably.


## How It Works

The SidecarTridge Kickstart emulator operates through a combination of advanced hardware and software techniques, replicating the functionality of the original ROMs at the signal level. This section explains the technical aspects of how the emulator functions, including bit-banged emulation and interaction with the computer bus.

### Bit-Banged Emulation

Bit-banging refers to the technique of manually driving the signals that would typically be handled by dedicated hardware. In this context, the emulator generates the necessary address and data signals to fully emulate the ROM chips. This involves coordinating the timing of these signals to match the original ROM's behavior precisely.

The emulator leverages the PIO capabilities of the Raspberry RP2040 and RP235x microcontroller. This technology allows precise control over the timing and sequencing of signals, enabling the emulator to mimic the behavior of the original 27CXXXX integrated circuits (and their equivalents) used in Atari ST computers. The PIO provides the necessary flexibility and accuracy to emulate the ROMs effectively, even at higher frequencies than original hardware.


### Flash Memory Storage

The Flash memory is a non-volatile memory that stores up to 16MB of data. This memory is used to store the ROM image files, the metadata of the ROM image files and the firmware of the device.

Users can connect the emulator to a computer via USB to manage ROM files. The emulator appears as a FAT16 mass storage device, allowing users to easily copy ROM image files. This USB interface simplifies the process of updating and switching ROMs without physically interacting with the Amigaâ€™s internals. The file system has been enhanced to provide information about the status of the emulator and the installed ROMs, as well as the ability to modify the default and rescue ROMs.

### Hot Swapping the ROMs from the Amiga

When powering the computer on, the SidecarTridge Kickstart emulator is already active and ready to provide the necessary ROM signals to the Amiga. The computer boots as usual, unaware that the ROM chips have been replaced with the emulator. There is no need to modify the Amiga hardware or perform any additional steps to enable the emulator.

SWITCHER is a user-friendly software provided for managing the ROMs. Users can select the desired Kickstart version or custom ROM from the Amiga itself, making the process of uploading ROMs using the host computer, switching ROMs as simple as launching a program, selecting the Kickstart, and rebooting the system.

### Developing and Testing Custom ROMs

The SidecarTridge Kickstart emulator is an encarnation of one of the possibilities of the SidecarTridge ROM emulator board. This board is designed to be versatile and flexible, allowing users of other retro platforms to develop solutions that require ROM emulation.

A simple API will be provided to allow developers to create their own software to upload ROMs from the Amiga computers themselves.

By incorporating these technical elements, the SidecarTridge Kickstart emulator provides a robust and flexible solution for managing and running different Kickstart versions and custom ROMs on the Amiga series, enhancing the usability and functionality of these classic computers.
