# Before You Buy

The SidecarTridge Kickstart emulator is designed to work with specific Amiga models and motherboards. There are different versions of the device to accommodate various motherboard configurations. **Please follow these steps before purchasing the emulator**:

### Check Your Amiga Motherboard Model

To learn more about your Amiga motherboard model, open the case and look for the model number printed on the board, usually located in the middle bottom of the motherboard. Refer to the [Compatibility](/sidecartridge-kickstart/compatibility/) section for a list of supported motherboards. If your motherboard model is not listed, please contact us for further assistance. If your motherboard model number is listed, proceed to the next step.
For example:

An Amiga 500 revision 5 motherboard model number might look like this:

### ROMs Plugged or Soldered

If your ROMs are plugged, congratulations, you can proceed with the purchase. If they are soldered, you will need to desolder them and plug them into sockets. 

{: .warning}
If you are not comfortable with desoldering and soldering, please seek professional help to avoid damaging your motherboard. We strongly recommend using an experienced technician to perform this task.

### Purchase the Right SidecarTridge Kickstart Emulator Kit

Once you have verified the compatibility of your Amiga 500 motherboard, you can proceed to purchase the appropriate SidecarTridge Kickstart emulator kit. Ensure you select the correct kit based on your motherboard model number.

| SidecarTridge Kickstart Emulator Kit | Supported Motherboards    |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| [A500 revision 3](https://store.sidecartridge.com)           | rev3 |
| [A500 revision 5](https://store.sidecartridge.com)           | rev5 |
| [A500 revision 6a](https://store.sidecartridge.com)           | rev6a |

### Identifying Your Amiga Motherboard Revision

I have followed the guidelines from [this blog](https://dfarq.homeip.net/amiga-500-motherboard-revisions) to create the following table to help you identify your Amiga 500 motherboard revision.

| Revision  | Motherboard  | Notable Features |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| rev3 | ![rev3](/sidecartridge-kickstart/assets/images/amiga500-3.jpeg) | Lack of silkscreen above the memory chips is the easiest way to identify an Amiga 500 revision 3 motherboard. |
| rev5 | ![rev5](/sidecartridge-kickstart/assets/images/amiga500-5.jpeg) | 16 RAM chips, with all of the positions populated. Above the RAM chips, you see a silkscreened identifier in white that says A500.  |
| rev6a | ![rev6a](/sidecartridge-kickstart/assets/images/amiga500-6a.jpeg) | White A500 silkscreen and 8 RAM chip positions rather than 16 to distinguish it from a rev 5 board. |
