# Before You Buy

The SidecarTridge TOS emulator is designed to work with specific Atari ST models and motherboards. There are different versions of the device to accommodate various motherboard configurations. **Please follow these steps before purchasing the emulator**:

### Check Your Atari ST Motherboard Model

To learn more about your Atari ST motherboard model, open the case and look for the model number printed on the board, usually located in the middle bottom of the motherboard. Refer to the [Compatibility](/sidecartridge-tos/compatibility/) section for a list of supported motherboards. If your motherboard model is not listed, please contact us for further assistance. If your motherboard model number is listed, proceed to the next step.
For example:

An Atari ST motherboard model number might look like this:

An Atari STE motherboard model number might look like this:

### Determine the Number of ROMs

At this moment, the SidecarTridge TOS emulator supports Atari ST motherboards with two ROM chips. If your motherboard has a different number of ROMs, you'll need to wait for the next version of the SidecarTridge TOS emulator with support for six ROMs.

### ROMs Plugged or Soldered

If your ROMs are plugged, congratulations, you can proceed with the purchase. If they are soldered, you will need to desolder them and plug them into sockets. 

{: .warning}
If you are not comfortable with desoldering and soldering, please seek professional help to avoid damaging your Atari ST motherboard. We strongly recommend using an experienced technician to perform this task.

### Purchase the Right SidecarTridge TOS Emulator Kit

Once you have verified the compatibility of your Atari ST motherboard, you can proceed to purchase the appropriate SidecarTridge TOS emulator kit. Ensure you select the correct kit based on your motherboard model number and the number of ROMs.
