# SidecarTridge TOS Emulator 
{: .d-inline-block }

The SidecarTridge TOS emulator is a compact board designed to emulate Atari ST internal ROMs, allowing users to access any TOS version or custom ROMs without swapping chips. 

This comprehensive guide provides detailed information about the SidecarTridge TOS emulator for the Atari ST series of computers. Please refer to the relevant sections below to explore specific topics.

There are two different versions of the SidecarTridge TOS emulator:
- **SidecarTridge TOS v1 and v2**: This version is designed for the Atari ST, STE, and Mega ST and Mega STE computers. It is based on the **Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller** and is mounted directly on top of the computer‚Äôs carrier board using a short pin header. This version is thinner, and when connected via USB or to the computer, there is no red LED to indicate power. You can see the board in the image above on the left side.
- **SidecarTridge TOS v3**: This version is designed for the Atari ST, STE, Mega ST, and Mega STE computers, but also there are versions in progress for other computers. It is based on the more powerful **Raspberry Pi RP2350 microcontroller** and is surface mounted directly on top of the computer‚Äôs carrier board with a soldered castellated board. This version is wider, and when connected via USB or to the computer, there is a **red LED** to indicate power. It also has a green LED to indicate the firmware is running, and an orange LED to indicate the internal USB drive is mounted. You can see the board in the image above on the right side.

**ALL BOARDS SHIPPED AFTER MID JUNE 2025 ARE v3 BOARDS.**
