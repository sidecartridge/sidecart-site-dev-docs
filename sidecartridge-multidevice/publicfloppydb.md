## Introduction

One notable feature of Sidecart is its ability to emulate Floppy Drives. This is executed efficiently; it does not consume any system RAM space. The driver needed for this emulation is exclusively located in the cartridge ROM, ensuring that system resources are used optimally and system performance is maintained.

One of the popular features of the SidecarT is the search and download of floppy images from the public database. This document explains how to add content to the public database of floppy images created by the users.

##Â The repository

The GitHub repository is located at [sidecartridge/atarist-public-floppy-db](https://github.com/sidecartridge/atarist-public-floppy-db).

This repository is a way to share with the community the floppy images that are created by the users and that are not available in the public database. The images are uploaded to an external repository, while the metadata is stored in this repository.

## List of floppies available

You can find the full list in the folder here: https://ataristdb.sidecartridge.com/db/*.csv

Where the asterisk is the first letter of the name of the floppy. The database is sharded by the first letter of the name of the floppy to allow the database to be easily parsed by the SidecarTridge Multi-device Floppy Database.

All the floppies added through the pull requests will be added to the database and will be available for the community as follows:
- It will be added to the database in its corresponding shard.
- It will be available in the special shard `_.csv` that contains all the new stuff sorted by most recent addenda. The maximum size of this file is 300 rows, so the oldest will be deleted when they reach this pointer.

## How to contribute

If you have a Floppy Image that is not listed here, you can contribute to the database by submitting a pull request with the following information:

- Name of the Floppy
- Description
- Type: can only be `CRACKTROS`, `DEMOS`, `HOMEBREW`,  `INTROS`.

**You must include the Floppy Image file in the pull request in .ST format.** The file must be in a single file. If the floppy has more than one disk, you must create a separate pull request for each disk.
