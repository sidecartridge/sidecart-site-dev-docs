## üöÄ Installation

To install the File & Download Manager app on your SidecarTridge Multi-device:

1. **Launch the Booster App** on your SidecarTridge Multi-device.
2. Open the **Booster web interface** in your browser.
3. Go to the **Apps** tab and select **File & Download Manager** from the available apps list.
4. Click **Download** to install the app to your SidecarTridge‚Äôs microSD card.
5. Once installed, select the app and click **Launch** to start it.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** The Booster Loader is currently in **alpha**. Use at your own risk.

After launching, the File & Download Manager app will run automatically every time your Atari is powered on.

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

When you start your Atari, the app displays a screen with a **QR code**. Scan this QR code with your smartphone or tablet to access the web interface, or enter the provided URL in any browser.

* To **bypass** the QR code screen and boot directly into GEMDOS, press any key.
* To **return to the Booster App** and select another app, press the **ESC** key.

### üíæ Floppy Images Database

Click the **Floppy DB** menu option in the web interface to access the **Floppy Images Database**. Here you can browse, search, filter, and download floppy images directly to your microSD card.

**Search Options:**

* **What's new:** Show only files recently added to the database.
* **Filter by label:** Narrow results by label, such as cracking team names or software type.

Start typing in the search box for smart suggestions. For example, typing `xe` will suggest titles like `Xevious` or `Xenon`.

![Floppy Images Database Search Results](/sidecartridge-multidevice/assets/images/BROWSER-FLOPPYDB-RESULT.png)

**Search results** appear as a table with:

* **Name**: File name
* **Date**: Date added
* **Label**: Associated label
* **Save to**: Button to save the file to your microSD

To download:

1. Click **Save to** next to the file you want.
2. Choose a destination folder from the dialog.
3. Click **Download Here** to start the download.

> **Note:** You must select a folder and then click **Download Here**; clicking the folder name alone is not enough.

When complete, your file is saved to the chosen folder. Use the [Drives Emulator](https://docs.sidecartridge.com/sidecartridge-multidevice/microfirmwares/drives_emulator/) or a solution like Gotek to access your files on your Atari.

### üîå USB Mass Storage Mode

You can also use your SidecarTridge Multi-device as a USB mass storage device. Simply connect it to your computer via USB, and the microSD card will mount as a regular USB drive. The QR code screen will show a message indicating USB Mass Storage Mode is active.

> **Note:** You can use the web interface and USB mode simultaneously, but changes made in one mode may not show up immediately in the other. Refresh your browser or file explorer to see updates.

### ‚èèÔ∏è Exiting to GEMDOS or Booster

* **ESC** on the QR code screen launches the **Booster** app.
* **Any other key** exits the emulator and boots into the Atari GEM desktop. The web interface remains active.
* To return to setup, press **SELECT** on your Multi-device and reboot, or power cycle your Atari.
* **Hold SELECT for 10 seconds** to reset your Multi-device to factory settings (useful for troubleshooting or starting fresh).

### ‚ôªÔ∏è System Reset Behavior

The Drives Emulator app is **resistant to system resets**. Pressing the Atari reset button will **not interrupt downloads or file management**; your session continues seamlessly.

### üîÑ Power Cycling

After a power cycle, the app automatically returns to the QR code screen, ready for the next session.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Features

#### Changing the microSD Card Speed

The SPI bus speed (1 MHz ‚Äì 24 MHz; default is 12.5 MHz) affects all microSD access and is configured in the Booster App:

1. Launch the **Booster App** (press **X** if you‚Äôre in another app).
2. Open the web interface and go to the **Config** tab.
3. Find **SD card bus speed (KHz)** and set your desired speed (e.g., `24000` for 24 MHz).
4. Click **Save** to apply.
5. Relaunch the **Drives Emulator** app.

> **Note:** Values below 1 MHz will default to 1 MHz; above 24 MHz will default to 24 MHz.
>
> **Tip:** 24 MHz is generally safe, but lower the speed if you encounter issues (e.g., 12.5 MHz or 6 MHz). Most modern microSD cards handle these speeds well.
