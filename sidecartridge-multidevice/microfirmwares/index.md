## Microfirmwares

### What is a microfirmware?

A Microfirmware app is a small, self-contained program that runs on a standalone RP2040 or RP235x chip, along with a companion firmware on your computer that talks to it. Together, they provide the features of the device.

### Available Microfirmware Apps

### How it works:

### Microfirmware App Core
This is the main program running on the RP2040 chip. It manages things like reading the microSD card, talking to the computer, and (if needed) providing a web interface.

#### Global Settings
These are settings for the whole device, stored in flash memory. The Microfirmware app reads them to know how the device is configured, but does not change them.

#### Local Settings
Each Microfirmware app can have its own settings, also stored in flash. These are used just by that app, so one app’s settings won’t affect another.

#### Computer Firmware
On the computer side, there is a small program (called the Booster app) that acts as a terminal and communicates with the Microfirmware app. Because this runs in the computer’s ROM, it’s harder to update and debug. Most testing and debugging happens on the Microfirmware app side.

The Booster App is designed to manage the Microfirmware apps on the device, allowing users to download, install, update, and launch them easily. It also provides a web interface for managing the apps.

The available Microfirmware apps are listed in a public repository, which the Booster app connects to. Users can browse and install apps from this repository, or upload their own apps to the device. They can also install their own repository for themselves or others to use.

### Developing Microfirmware Apps

To develop your own Microfirmware apps, there is a  [template repository](https://github.com/sidecartridge/md-microfirmware-template) and follow the instructions in the [Programming Guide](/sidecartridge-multidevice/programming/).

Each Microfirmware app should be a self-contained program that can run on the RP2040 or RP235x chip. It should include the necessary code to read the microSD card, communicate with the computer, and provide any additional features you want. 

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues or bugs while using the Microfirmware apps, please report them to help us improve the software. You can find the list of issues and report new ones in the [Issues and Bug Reporting](/sidecartridge-multidevice/issues/) section.
