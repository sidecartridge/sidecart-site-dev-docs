# Before You Buy

The SidecarTridge TOS 256KB decoder is designed to work ONLY with specific Atari ST and MegaST models and motherboards. There are different versions of the device to accommodate various motherboard configurations. 

**Please follow these steps before purchasing the emulator**:

### Check Your Atari ST Motherboard Model

To learn more about your Atari ST motherboard model, open the case and look for the model number printed on the board, usually located in the middle bottom of the motherboard. Refer to the [Compatibility](/sidecartridge-tos-256kb-decoder/compatibility/) section for a list of supported motherboards. If your motherboard model is not listed, please contact us for further assistance. If your motherboard model number is listed, proceed to the next step.

For example:

An Atari ST motherboard model number might look like this:

### Dual or Hexa ROM Configuration

While the 256KB Decoder is designed for computers with two (DUAL) and six (HEXA) ROM sockets, the online store currently offers only the DUAL version for motherboards 070789-001, C103175-001, C103414-001 and the Mega ST C103544-001, C103277, C100167, C100501. The Six ROMS version is only available for the "short ST" motherboards C070243. If you have a special request, please contact us for more information.

### ROMs Plugged or Soldered

If your ROMs are plugged, congratulations, you can proceed with the purchase. If they are soldered, you will need to desolder them and plug them into sockets. 

{: .warning}
If you are not comfortable with desoldering and soldering, please seek professional help to avoid damaging your Atari ST motherboard. We strongly recommend using an experienced technician to perform this task.

###  A note about the Blitter Patch in the Mega ST

Most of the Mega ST motherboards have a Blitter patch soldered on top of the Motorola 68000 CPU. While the SidecarTridge TOS 256KB decoder V1.0 is compatible with the Blitter patch, the version 2.0 (Released 28th of February 2025) already has the Blitter patch integrated into the design. This means that you can use the SidecarTridge TOS 256KB decoder V2.0 and removing the Blitter patch.

### Purchase the Right SidecarTridge TOS 256KB Decoder Kit

Once you have verified the compatibility of your Atari ST motherboard, you can proceed to purchase the appropriate SidecarTridge TOS 256KB Decoder emulator kit. Ensure you select the correct kit based on your motherboard model number and the number of ROMs.
