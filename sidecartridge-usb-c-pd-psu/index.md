# SidecarTridge USB-C PD Multi-Rail Power Supply Unit board

## The USB-C PD Multi-Rail Power Supply Unit board

This USB-C Power Delivery multi-rail converter board is designed to generate clean, regulated +5 V, +12 V, and −12 V inside the machine. The output rails can deliver up to 3 A on +5 V, 3 A on +12 V, and 0.3 A on −12 V. It is intended for use in retro computing applications, such as powering vintage computers like the Atari ST/STE/MegaST or Amiga 500 or other electronics projects that require multiple voltage rails.

The board is powered by a USB-C PD charger that must provide either 15 V or 20 V input voltage. It includes overcurrent and thermal protection features to ensure safe operation. The board is compact and easy to integrate into existing systems, making it a convenient solution for powering retro computing devices.
