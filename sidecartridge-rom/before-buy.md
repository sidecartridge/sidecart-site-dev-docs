## This is a module (not plug-and-play)

The SidecarTridge ROM Emulator is **not a standalone consumer product**.
It is a **module** that must be integrated into host hardware—typically by being **soldered onto a custom carrier board**.

## What you need

- A compatible carrier board / host design for your target system.
- Tools to solder and inspect castellated pads.
- A stable 5V supply and correct logic-level interfacing.

## What ROM types/sizes are supported

_TODO: add a clear matrix of supported ROM families, pinouts, sizes (4KB–512KB), and 8/16-bit widths._

## ROM images & licensing

The ROM Emulator does **not** ship with proprietary ROM images.
You must provide ROM images that you are legally allowed to use.
