## Overview

The ROM Emulator module must be integrated into host hardware.
In most real-world builds, that means the ROM Emulator is **soldered onto a custom carrier board** that adapts it to the target system’s ROM socket/pinout and mechanical constraints.

## Carrier board requirements

_TODO: describe mechanical, electrical, and pin-mapping requirements._

## Soldering & inspection

_TODO: provide a soldering checklist and common failure modes (bridges/cold joints/alignment)._

## Powering

_TODO: USB vs external supply, safe sequencing, and decoupling guidance._
