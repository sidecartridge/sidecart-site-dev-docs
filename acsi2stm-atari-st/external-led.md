# üîå External Activity LED

This section explains how to connect an external activity LED to the **ACSI2STM** device. This is especially useful in systems like the **Atari Mega ST** and **Mega STe**, where the ACSI2STM is installed inside the case and its onboard activity LED is not visible.

## üß© LED Circuit Overview

Earlier ACSI2STM versions included an onboard orange SMD activity LED. However, since it‚Äôs not visible once the device is mounted inside an Atari Mega case, **revision 2.1 (April 2025)** added a circuit to support an external LED.

### Circuit Components

- **EXTLED 1x2 Pin Header**  
  A 2-pin header is provided on the PCB (below the onboard LED) labeled `EXTLED`. Polarity labels (+/-) are printed on the board.  
  > *Note: This header is not pre-soldered. You must install it yourself.*

- **SMD 220Œ© Resistor**  
  Soldered on the PCB by default, this resistor limits the current through the external LED.

- **Through-Hole Resistor Footprint**  
  An alternative to the SMD resistor, this placeholder allows the user to fine-tune LED brightness with a custom resistor.  
  > *Important: If you use the through-hole resistor, you should first remove the SMD resistor to avoid reducing total resistance too much.*

By default, the circuit is compatible with the stock **Mega STe front-panel HDD activity LED**. However, LED brightness can vary depending on the LED‚Äôs forward voltage and current. In many cases, users may find the LED too dim and choose to replace the SMD resistor with a lower-value through-hole resistor (e.g., 220Œ© or less).

## üîå Connecting the Mega STe Activity LED

Because the ACSI2STM cannot be placed directly inside the Mega STe case, you‚Äôll typically use a riser board like [this one](https://sidecartridge.com/products/acsi2stm-riser-board-atari-st/) or a [custom version](http://joo.kie.sk/?page_id=224).

To connect the activity LED:

1. Locate the front-panel HDD activity LED connector (a 2-wire cable inside the drive bay).
2. Unplug it from the Atari motherboard.
3. Connect it to the `EXTLED` header on your ACSI2STM board.  
   > Polarity is critical

That‚Äôs it. If the LED brightness is not ideal, continue to the section on resistor customization.

## üîå Connecting a Custom LED on the Mega ST

Unlike the Mega STe, the **Mega ST has no built-in HDD activity LED**, so you‚Äôll need to build a basic LED cable:

1. **LED** ‚Äî Choose a 3mm or 5mm LED with suitable forward voltage (~2.0V for red/green).
2. **Resistor** ‚Äî Use the SMD resistor on the board, or replace it with a through-hole resistor of your choice.
3. **Cable** ‚Äî A simple 2-wire cable with a 1x2 female connector (Dupont) is ideal.

Be sure to observe LED polarity: the longer leg is positive (+).

üëâ You can place the LED anywhere you like ‚Äî for example, drill a small hole in the front of the Mega ST case for a clean install.

## üîß Using a Custom Through-Hole Resistor

If the default 220Œ© SMD resistor doesn‚Äôt provide the brightness you want, you can swap it for a through-hole resistor:

1. **Remove the SMD resistor** using a soldering iron and tweezers.
2. **Install a through-hole resistor** in the designated footprint.

Start with values like **220Œ© for ~6mA**, or **470Œ© for ~3mA**, depending on your LED specs and desired brightness.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Do **not** leave both resistors in place ‚Äî using the SMD and through-hole resistor together will reduce total resistance too much and may damage the LED or overdraw GPIO current.
